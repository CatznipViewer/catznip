[Inventory/Misc]
- added : "DeclineTaskOfferToTrash" to accept inventory offers from objects into the trash when declining
- added : "Move to 'Lost and Found'" to the inventory context menu for unparented folders
    -> folders with a NULL UUID parent will show as existing on the same level as "My Inventory"
    -> regular drag-and-drop or other inventory operations won't succeed and fixing normally requires Linden Lab intervention
- added : "Open in New Window" option to the inventory context-menu for folders
- fixed : dropping a direct descendent of an outfit folder onto the folder shouldn't create a link to the dropped item
- fixed : moving a folder link to a different folder moves the target folder rather the folder link
- fixed : right-click open + "Copy to Inventory" triggers the task opener inventory observer and incoming item throttle
- fixed : "Buy" and "Buy Contents" floater show the "multi object" icon for half of the wearable types
    -> the inventory flags were being OR'ed with II_FLAGS_LANDMARK_VISITED which equals 1
    -> every odd valued LLWearable::EType would be shown with the "multi object" icon rather than the proper wearable type icon
- fixed : "Find Original" in an inventory floater highlights the link in the inventory sidebar if it's currently visible
    -> Repro:
         - open the inventory sidebar
         - open an inventory floater
         - expand "Current Outfit" on the inventory floater and pick "Find Original"
- fixed : "Share" doesn't remember the original inventory selection
    -> Repro:
         (1) open inventory sidebar and select an item + collapse the sidebar
         (2) open two inventory floaters and right-click "Share" an item on the second floater
         (3) close the second inventory floater
         => after selecting a resident you'll see "Are you sure you want to share: My Inventory"
- fixed : EXP-922 (revision 621882f33b50) causes the entire inventory to be fetched at log-on
    -> hiding the Inbox folder results in LLInventoryFilter::isNotDefault() returning TRUE
    -> LLFolderViewFolder::filter() will then kick off LLInventoryModelBackgroundFetch::instance().start() on the root folder with recursive == true
- fixed : additional inventory floater instances (beyond the first one) are never destroyed when closed
    -> introduced by EXP-1423 (revision 0a9821fdd78a)
    -> LLFloaterInventory is actually dead code
