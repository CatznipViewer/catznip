[Inventory/Misc]
- fixed : dragging the "Contents" folder from object inventory to agent inventory shows the "prohibited" cursor
    -> should copy the contents of the object to the inventory folder it was dropped on
- fixed : dropping a direct descendent of an outfit folder onto the folder shouldn't create a link to the dropped item
