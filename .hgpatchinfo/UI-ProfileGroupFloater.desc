[UI/ProfileGroupFloater]
- added : "ShowProfileFloaters" setting to show profiles in floaters rather than the sidebar
    -> TODO: code is rather rough at the moment and needs revisiting
- fixed : drag-and-drop of inventory items onto a profile no longer works
    -> LL's using the session_id to get the name of the resident which is rather puzzling
