- changed : LLCacheName::buildUsername() will properly extract the username if the passed name is a "complete name"
    -> "Catznip Catnap" => "catznip.catnap"
    -> "Catznip Tester (catznip.catnap)" => "catznip.catnap"
- fixed   : IM logs are not saved when display names are turned off
- fixed   : P2P IM session names are inconsistent (chiclet hover tip shows the legacy name rather than the complete name for incoming IM sessions)
    -> incoming IM session would have a session name of "Catznip Catnap" (legacy name)
    -> outgoing IM session would have a session name of "Catznip Tester (catznip.catnap)" (complete name)
    -> standarized P2P IM session names to "complete name"
