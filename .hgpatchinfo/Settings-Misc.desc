[Settings/Misc]
- fixed : "Plain text chat history" reverts to FALSE if the relevant preference tab is opened while not logged on
- added : "DebugTimeMessageDecoding" setting to aid with viewer stalling or inventory fetching problems
- fixed : (Un)checking "Custom Port" in preferences shows a notification that can't be dismissed
    -> see http://redmine.catznip.com/issues/14
- added : "InspectNearbyRemoteObject" setting to show the object inspector for "objectim" app URLs for nearby objects
    -> affects plain text chat where llOwnerSay(), llSay() and llInstantMessage() chat from scripts always opens the "remote object inspector" by default
- fixed : remote object inspector isn't passed any parameters for object IMs
    -> query string is constructed but was never appended to the "objectim" app URL
