[Agent/DisplayNames]
- added : "AgentLinkShowUsernames" setting to control when the username is shown as part of an agent app URL label
    -> 0 = Always show the username as part of the label, i.e. "Kitty Barnett (kitty.barnett)"
       1 = Only show the username as part of the label on mismatch, i.e. "Kitty Barnett (random.resident)"
       2 = Never show the username as part of the label (will still be visible on the tooltip)
