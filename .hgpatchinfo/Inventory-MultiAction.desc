[Inventory/MultiAction]
- added   : LLFolderViewerListener::peformActionBatch() to handle an action for multiple items of the same type
- changed : routed LLFolderView::openSelectedItems() to LLFolderView::doToSelected(..., "open")
    -> fixes <enter>'ing on a selection resulting in "Attachment pending"
