[UI/SidepanelPlaces]
- added : "Search" panel to the places sidepanel floater
    -> uses the legacy search backend that was added in UI-Search
- changed : don't show "Library" landmarks in the landmarks places sidepanel
- changed : cleaned up XUI layout and made it more consistent with other sidepanel floaters

[Control/Button]
- changed : draw the centered image overlay of a button to the left of its label instead of behind it
    -> consistent with how left and right aligned image overlays are displayed
