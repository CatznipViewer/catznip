[UI/SidepanelPeople]
- added   : distance field in the "Nearby" people sidebar tab
- added   : slider to the "Nearby" people sidebar panel to easily adjust the "NearMeRange" setting (inspired by Starlight)
- added   : "Show within Range", "Show on Current Parcel" and "Show on Current Region" options to the nearby people sidebar tab gear menu
- changed : "NearbyPeopleSortOrder" setting default from "by recent speakers" to "by distance"
- changed : friend permissions can be toggled directly from the friends list
- changed : attempt to get the Z-position from an avatar instance if the CoarseLocationUpdate for an agent's Z-position is zero
- changed : don't show the "profile button" and "speaking indicator" on the "My Friends" avatar list in the people sidebar tab
- changed : don't show the "speaking indicator" on the "Recent" avatar list in the people sidebar tab
- changed : moved the avatar list item text field to the next-to-last slot
    -> prevents other icons from popping into view when hovering (and subsequently displacing the text field)
- changed : line up shown avatar list item child controls in columns rather than compacting them together
    -> before: 1 2 3 4 => 2 used but invisible => 3 unused => 1 4
               1 2 3 4 => 2 used and visible   => 3 unsued => 1 2 4
    -> after : 1 2 3 4 => 2 used but invisible => 3 unused => 1 2 4
               1 2 3 4 => 2 used and visible   => 3 unsued => 1 2 4
    => as long as a "column" is shown then all items will have a dedicated (empty) visible space for it
- changed : display the complete name in an avatar list control when a filter is active

[UI/ContextMenus]
- added   : "Kick" and "Teleport Home" estate options to the "Manage" avatar context submenu
- added   : "Teleport" option to the avatar context menu
- added   : "Report", "Eject", "Freeze" and "Zoom In" to the "Nearby" people sidebar panel context menu
    -> also reordered the menu options to match the "Inspect Avatar" gear dropdown menu
	-> "Freeze" and "Eject" and "Kick" and "Teleport Home" operate on both single and multiple avatars
    -> new methods don't suffer from the limitation that they only work on avatars who made it on the interest list
- changed : "Freeze/Unfreeze" and "Eject/Ban" on the avatar context menu use the new LLAvatarActions functions
    -> adds the ability to affect agents outside of draw distance and (improved) display name handling
- changed : moved "Block", "Report", "Freeze" and "Eject" to a "Manage" sub-menu on the avatar menu, the avatar inspect menu and the nearby people menu
- changed : removed "Share" from the avatar inspect menu and the nearby people menu
- changed : swapped "Pay" and "Invite to Group" on the 4 avatar context menus
