[Viewer/CrashReporting]
- added   : SaveMinidumpType setting to control minidump creation type [Windows-only]
    -> include MiniDumpFilterModulePaths by default to strip loaded module paths
- changed : Windows crash logger will send crash reports to catznip.com if crash reporting is enabled
    -> pruned some of the information that's normally saved to debug_info.log
