[UI/Misc]

    -> collapses the floater in-place rather than moving it to a different part of the screen and changing the width of the title bar
- added   : "Inspect" menu item to bring up the old-style Inspect floater
    -> added to the context menus for: "attachment self", "attachment other" and "object"
    -> added to the gear menu for object inspectors
- added   : "Add Contact" option to various context menus
    -> creates a calling card for that avatar in the "Calling Cards" folder

    -> "Show Buy L$ Button", "Show Marketplace Button" and "Show Network Statistics"

- changed : embedded the "Mini-Location" bar into the status bar
    -> "Mini-Location" bar can also be shown independently of the navigation bar
    -> removed the info button
