[Inventory/Panel]
- added   : user-add'able inventory panels to the inventory floater by clicking on the "+" tab
    -> don't delete the last user-added inventory panel so it can be reused (controlled by InventoryReuseUserTab)
- added   : sort button to the inventory floater's toolbar panel
    -> sort options were removed from the main gear menu and moved to the sort menu
- added   : "Show Filter" button to the main inventory floater
- added   : "InventoryDnDCheckFilter" setting to keep current drag-and-drop inventory behaviour or restore "legacy" behaviour
    -> behaviour changed as a result of EXP-1335
    -> if we're dragging from agent inventory to agent inventory we can simply check if the item is filtered in the destionation panel
    -> allow moving an object's folder as long as one item passes the filter when "InventoryDnDCheckFilter" is TRUE
    -> LLInventoryFilter::check(const LLInventoryItem* item) didn't correctly match the filter substring
- added   : "Show Received Items Panel" option to the inventory floater gear menu
- added   : "Separate Text Filters" inventory gear menu option
    -> LLPanelMainInventory can have the text filter shared among all tabs, or separate per tab
- added   : "Default action" button to the inventory toolbar to replace the three button row
    -> additionally, added an action fly-out button to offer multiple actions for the current selection
- changed : behaviour of "Cut" inventory items
    -> don't hide/filter inventory items that have been "Cut"
    -> don't move "Cut" inventory items to the trash
    -> "Cut" inventory items now have a distinct visual look
- changed : tighted the inventory floater layout
    -> moved item count to the floater title
    -> reduced vertical whitespace
    -> tightened the received items panel
- changed : always show the "Received Items" folder if the inventory's panel contents are filtered (with a non-default filter)
- changed : moved "Find All Links" from the gear menu to the inventory item context menu and the fly-out actions menu
- changed : only show "Find All Links" for inventory items and don't show it for folders
- changed : removed "Save Texture As" and "Share" menu options from the inventory gear menu
- changed : moved the "Upload" sub-menu from the top to the bottom of the inventory add toolbar menu
- fixed   : saving an inventory filter and then restoring it results in all items being hidden
    -> date filters are set back all wrong
- fixed   : don't show the "Upload" submenu as being tear-off
- fixed   : "Received Items" panels on secondary inventory floaters are non-functional
- fixed   : empty folders remain visible in the "Recent" tab
- fixed   : "Edit" option on the inventory context menu doesn't enable/disable properly for wearable items
    -> always disabled for items in COF
    -> always enabled for items outside of COF
- fixed : folder links aren't visible
    -> since they have the inentory type of LLInventoryType::IT_CATEGORY they were being treated as folders

	
"Collapse All" button to the inventory floater toolbar
  -> will not collapse top-level folders (= My Inventory of Library) if they are currently open
