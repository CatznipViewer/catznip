[Viewer/Crash]
- fixed : [CRASH-1] LLViewerTextureList::removeImageFromList() and LLViewerTextureList::addImageToList()
    -> previous fix didn't actually address the problem: the decode priority ends up as NaN which messes with the comparison operator
- fixed : crash opening a classified when the viewer is disconnected
- fixed : crash when attempting to send an open snapshot as a postcard when the viewer is disconnected
- fixed : various crashes due to gAgent.getRegion() == NULL when the viewer is disconnected
- fixed : viewer idles for a few seconds before shutting down after clicking the close button
    -> send the stats package but don't sit around for 5 seconds waiting for the response since we'll idle waiting for the logout acknowledgement in the next step anyway
