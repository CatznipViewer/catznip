[Control/TextEditor]
- added   : drag-moving of the current selection in a text editor control

[UI/Notecards]
- added   : Ctrl-F to open the Search/Replace floater for notecards
- added   : "Search Up" checkbox on the "Search / Replace" floater
- added   : "Open", "Copy to Inventory" and "Teleport" context menu options for embedded items
- added   : "EmbeddedLandmarkCopyToInventory" to control whether embedded landmarks are copied to inventory before previewing
- added   : "EmbeddedTextureStealsFocus" to control whether embedded texture previews take focus when opened
- fixed : embedded notecards are silently copied to inventory rather than opened when 'ShowNewInventory' is set to TRUE
- fixed   : saving a notecard in object inventory shows an empty notecard after the save completes
- fixed   : notecard preview floater doesn't remember its position and size
- fixed   : properly hand off the Search/Replace floater when dependant on a notecard/script preview inside of a multipreview floater

[UI/Textures]
- changed : layout of the texture preview floater
    -> moved the "Aspect Ratio" combobox to the top-right corner
    -> rearranged the options in the "Aspect Ration" combobox slight to list the more common ARs at the top
    -> lined texture dimensions up with the "OK", "Discard" and "Save As" buttons
    -> adjusted the spacing around the texture for a more pleasing visual look (see llpreviewtexture.cpp)
- fixed   : embedded texture previews have a blank floater title
