[Viewer/FullscreenWindow]
- fixed : window position isn't (properly) saved on quit if the window is maximized or minimized [Windows only]
- fixed : window size isn't (properly) saved on quit if the window is maximized or minimized [Windows only]
- added : fullscreen window support (doesn't require a resolution change or OpenGL context switching) [Windows only]
    -> doesn't blank out the other monitors
    -> provides quick and seamless switching back and forth between other applications
- fixed : fullscreen window serves as a partial fix for the lack of a fullscreen option in SL-2.X
    -> re-added fullscreen menu option (enables only if available for the platform)
    -> re-enabled Alt-Enter shortcut for toggling between "default" and "fullscreen"
- added : added "Fullscreen" as an option to the Advanced / Set Window Size... floater
    -> BUG - picking a non-fullscreen window size doesn't switch out of fullscreen
