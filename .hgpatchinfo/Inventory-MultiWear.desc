[Inventory/MultiWear]
- dependency : depends on Inventory/MultiAction
- dependency : [partial] depends on Appearance/Misc to "fix" LLAppearanceMgr::filterWearableItems
- added      : LLWearableBridge::performActionBatch() wears multiple wearables at once
    -> fixes some instances of COF "corruption"
- changed    : <enter>'ing a selection of wearables will wear them if at least one is unworn or remove them if all are worn
    -> undesired edge case would be a selection of all worn wearables + 1 unworn attachment => attachment will get attached while the wearables are removed
- fixed      : double-clicking a wearable wears it if it's unworn and removes it if it's worn
    -> behaviour is made consistent with the double-click behaviour of an attachment
